# FSAI-Extras
This repo contains any code which is involved in showing Future Sight AI. This may include files used for managing the live stream on the [website](https://pokemonbattlepredictor.com/FSAI), calculating stats and numbers referenced with in it, or even for animating the videos.

## Folder Descriptions
### Live Stream
  Files used for displaying battles and charts of the AI's current game. The website is using Google Sites (hey, programmers don't always have to make their own websites), which means all of these must run in their own iframe and stay in sync without communicating directly.
